*Story:* Validating a connection 

As Operations
I want to save a validated connection definition to a quartz instance
So that I know the connection data is valid and I can assign security to the definition

Scenario 1: Valid remoting URL
Given the remoting endpoint is available
When the definition contains a valid remoting URL
Then the system successfully creates a remote object to validate the URL
and the definition is stored
and the user is notified that the definition was stored

Scenario 2: Invalid remoting URL
When the definition contains an invalid remoting URL
Then the system fails to create a remote object while trying to valid the URL
and the definition is not stored
and the user is notified that the specified remoting URL could not be validated
and the user is notified that the definition was not stored
