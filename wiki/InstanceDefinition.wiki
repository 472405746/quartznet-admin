*Story:* Creating a connection definition

 * As Operations
 * I want to create pre-configured connection definitions
 * So that I can quickly connect to Quartz instances.

  # Scenario: Accessing the "Create Connection" page
    * Given that all requirements for creating a connection definition have been met
    * When the user selects "Create Connection" from the "Connection List" page
    * Then the "Create Connection" page is displayed
    * and the "Connection Name" field is displayed
    * and the "Connection Type" drop down is displayed with a default value of "Database"
    * and the database connection parameter template is displayed.
  # Scenario: Saving a connection definition
    * Given that all requirements for creating a connection definition have been met
    * and the user has specified valid values for all of the fields
    * When the user attempts to save a new connection definition
    * Then the new connection definition is saved
    * and the "Connection List" page is displayed.

Story: Required connection name

As Operations
I want each connection definition to have a human-readable name
So that I can easily identify connection definitions.

Scenario: Saving a connection definition without a name
Given that all requirements for creating a connection definition have been met
and the user did not specify a name on the "Create Connection" page
When the user attempts to save a new connection definition
Then the new connection definition is not saved
and the user is notified that they must specify a name. 

Story: Unique connection name

As Operations
I want each connection definition to have a unique name
So that the connection name can be used as an identifier.

Scenario: Saving a connection definition with an existing name
Given that all requirements for creating a connection definition have been met
and the user specified a name that is already in use on the "Create Connection" page
When the user attempts to save a new connection definition
Then the new connection definition is not saved
and the user is notified that the specified name is already in use.

Story: Database connection parameter template

As Operations
I want the system to provide a template for entering database connection parameters
So that I do not have to look up the required parameter keys when defining a new connection.

Scenario: Specifying database connection parameters
Given that all requirements for creating a connection definition have been met
When the user selects "Database" as the connection type on the "Create Connection" page
Then the following fields are displayed... (TBD, should include Instance Name)

Story: Remoting connection parameter template

As Operations
I want the system to provide a template for entering remoting connection parameters
So that I do not have to look up the required parameter keys when defining a new connection.

Scenario: Specifying remoting connection parameters
Given that all requirements for creating a connection definition have been met
When the user selects "Remoting" as the connection type on the "Create Connection" page
Then the following fields are displayed... (TBD, should include Instance Name)

Story: Custom connection parameters

As Operations
I want the ability to enter a custom set of connection parameters
So that I can handle situations where the templates are not appropriate.

Scenario: Specifying custom connection parameters
Given that all requirements for creating a connection definition have been met
When the user selects "Custom" as the connection type on the "Create Connection" page
Then a set of n (TBD) key and value fields are displayed on the page.

Story: Valid connection parameters

As Operations
I want to validate a connection definition before it is saved
So that I am sure that the connection information is complete and accurate.

Scenario: Saving a valid connection definition
Given that all requirements for creating a connection definition have been met
and the user has specified valid connection parameters
When the user attempts to save the new connection definition
Then the system is able to connect to the Quartz instance
and the new connection definition is saved.

Scenario: Saving an invalid connection definition
Given that all requirements for creating a connection definition have been met
and the user has specified invalid connection parameters
When the user attempts to save the new connection definition
Then the system is not able to connect to the Quartz instance
and the new connection definition is saved
and the user is notified that the system could not connect to the instance with the specified connection parameters.
