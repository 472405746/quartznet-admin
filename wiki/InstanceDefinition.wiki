*Story:* Defining a connection 

As Operations
I want to save a connection definition to a quartz instance which contains a human readable name and all information required to make a connection
So that I can identify and connect to a running quartz instance

  # Scenario: Valid name and connection information
    When the a valid name and connection information are entered
    Then the connection is saved

  # Scenario: Name is already in use
    Given the specified name is already in use
    When the name is specified for a new connection
    Then the connection is not saved
    and the user is notified that the name is already in use

  # Scenario: Name not specified
    When the name is not specified
    Then the connection is not saved
    and the user is notified that the name is required

  # Scenario: Connection properties not specified
    When no connection properties are specified
    Then the connection is not saved
    and the user is notified that at least one connection property is required
