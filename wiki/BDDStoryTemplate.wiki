#summary BDD Story Template

One of the goals of this project is to utilize the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) methodology for analysis and design. A key practice in BDD is to capture the definition of features in the form of stories. A story describes the scope of a feature, why it is beneficial, who it benefits, and its acceptance criteria.  A feature is considered complete when all of the criteria has been met.
