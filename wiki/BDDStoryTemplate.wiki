#summary BDD Story Template

= Introduction =

One of the goals of this project is to utilize the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) methodology for analysis and design. A key practice in BDD is to capture the definition of features in the form of stories. A story describes the scope of a feature, why it is beneficial, who it benefits, and its acceptance criteria.  A feature is considered complete when all of the criteria has been met.

It is highly recommened that you read the following two articles if you are not familiar with this process:

= Analysis =

For this project, we will use the standard story template:

1) Title

 Story: (one line describing the story)
 
2) Narative
 
 As a (role)<br>
 I want (feature)<br>
 So that (benefit)<br>

3) Acceptance criteria

 Scenario 1: Title<br>
 Given (context)<br>
 And (some more context)...<br>
 When (event)<br>
 Then (outcome)<br>
 And (another outcome)...<br>

 Scenario 2: ...

For example:

 Story: Defining a connection

 As a system administrator<br>
 I want to save validated connection definitions to quartz instance<br>
 So that I know the connection data is valid and I can assign security to the definition<br>

 Scenario 1: Valid remoting URL<br>
 Given the remoting endpoint is available<br>
 When the definition contains a valid remoting URL<br>
 Then the system successfully creates a remote object to validate the URL<br>
 and the definition is stored<br>
 and the user is notified that the definition was stored<br>

 Scenario 2: Invalid remoting URL<br>
 When the definition contains an invalid remoting URL<br>
 Then the system fails to create a remote object while trying to valid the URL<br>
 and the definition is not stored<br>
 and the user is notified that the specified remoting URL could not be validated<br>
 and the user is notified that the definition was not stored<br>
