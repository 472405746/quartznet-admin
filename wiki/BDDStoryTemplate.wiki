#summary BDD Story Template

= Introduction =

One of the goals of this project is to utilize the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) methodology for analysis and design. A key practice in BDD is to capture the definition of features in the form of stories. A story describes the scope of a feature, why it is beneficial, who it benefits, and its acceptance criteria.  A feature is considered complete when all of the criteria has been met.

It is highly recommened that you read the following two articles if you are not familiar with this process:

= Analysis =

For this project, we will use the standard story template:

Title (one line describing the story)

Narrative<br>
As a (role)<br>
I want (feature)<br>
So that (benefit)<br>

Acceptance Criteria: (presented as Scenarios)

Scenario 1: Title<br>
Given (context)<br>
And (some more context)...<br>
When  (event)<br>
Then  (outcome)<br>
And (another outcome)...<br>

Scenario 2: ...


For example:

Story: Connecting to Quartz Instance (via Remoting)

As a security analyst
I want to connect to a Quartz instance via remoting
So that the Quartz database is not exposed directly

Scenario 1: Valid address
Given the remoting endpoint is available
When the user specifies a valid address
Then the system creates a remote object to validate its existence
and the address is stored for later use
and the user is notified that the new endpoint has been saved

Scenario 2: Invalid address
When the user specifies an invalid address
Then the system fails to valid the existence of the remote object
and and address is not stored for later use
and the user is notified that the endpoint was not saved
