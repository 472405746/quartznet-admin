#summary BDD Story Template

= Introduction =

One of the goals of this project is to utilize the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) methodology for analysis and design. A key practice in BDD is to capture the definition of features in the form of stories. A story describes the scope of a feature, why it is beneficial, who it benefits, and its acceptance criteria.  A feature is considered complete when all of the criteria has been met.

It is highly recommened that you read the following two articles if you are not familiar with this process:
